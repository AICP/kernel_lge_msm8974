Setting simple platform device name

In case of legacy platform bus, device name could be set to combination
with name and id of device in platform data of machine-board file.
Especially, device name was same as platform device name itself when
device id is -1.

Now, in the age of device tree, platform device name consists of node name
and unique id from global atomic value which are increased by registering
order. So, this name has variant by device environment even though it points
to same device. For example, simple platform device, "simple_dev" supports
sysfs for user space to provide device information may have name as
"simple_dev.95" in A device. But, same platform device in B devices may have
"simple_dev.83" as name. Therefore, user space can't determine proper sysfs
to get the information.

Of course, this can be solved by using class driver. But, to simple platform
driver like "simple_dev" as above example, usage of class driver is cost-waste.

By this reason, it introduces two properties as following;

- platform,dev,id
- platform,dev,name

If platform,dev,id and platform,dev,name are exist both, name is assigned to
[name].[id].

If platform,dev,id is 0 and platform,dev,name is exist, name is assigned to
[name].

If platform,dev,id is exist only, name is assigned to [node name].[id].

If platform,dev,id is not exist(at this time, existence of name is not care),
name is followed by original setting([node name].[unique id by atomic value]).

Example:
&soc {
	...
	platform,device,A@0 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <3>;

		/* /sys/devices/sim/... */
		platform,dev,id = <0>;
		platform,dev,name = "sim";
	};

	platform,device,B@1 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <3>;

		/* /sys/devices/sim.32/... */
		platform,dev,id = <32>;
		platform,dev,name = "sim";

	};

	platform,device,C@1 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <3>;

		/* maybe /sys/devices/platform,device,C.36/... */
		platform,dev,name = "sim";
	};

	...
};
