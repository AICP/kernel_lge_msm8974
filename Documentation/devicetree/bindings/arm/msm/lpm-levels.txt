* Low Power Management Levels

The application processor in MSM can do a variety of C-States for low power
management. These C-States are invoked by the CPUIdle framework when the core
becomes idle. But based on the time available until the next scheduled wakeup,
the system can do several low power modes. The combination is captured in the
device tree as lpm-level.

The required nodes for lpm-levels are:

- compatible: "qcom,lpm-levels"
- reg: The numeric level id
- qcom,mode: The sleep mode of the processor, values for the property are:
		"wfi" - Wait for Interrupt
		"ramp_down_and_wfi" - Ramp down and wait for interrupt
		"standalone_pc" - Standalone power collapse
		"pc" - Power Collapse
		"retention" - Retention
		"pc_suspend" - Suspended Power Collapse
		"pc_no_xo_shutdown" - Power Collapse with no XO shutdown
- qcom,l2: The state of L2 cache. Values are:
		"l2_cache_pc" - L2 cache in power collapse
		"l2_cache_pc_no_rpm" - L2 cache in power collapse. This mode wouldn't inform the RPM
		"l2_cache_retenetion" - L2 cache in retention
		"l2_cache_gdhs" - L2 cache in GDHS
		"l2_cache_active" - L2 cache in active mode
- qcom,latency-us: The latency in handling the interrupt if this level was
	chosen, in uSec
- qcom,ss-power: The steady state power expelled when the processor is in this
	level in mWatts
- qcom,energy-overhead: The energy used up in entering and exiting this level
	in mWatts.uSec
- qcom,time-overhead: The time spent in entering and exiting this level in uS

The optional nodes for lpm-levels are :
-  qcom,no-l2-saw: Indicates if this target has an L2 SAW (SPM and AVS wrapper).
-  qcom,default-l2-state: Indicates what the default low power state of the L2 SAW should be. This property is used only when there is an L2 SAW.

Example:

qcom,lpm-levels {
	qcom,no-l2-saw;
	qcom,lpm-level@0 {
		reg = <0>;
		qcom,mode = "wfi";
		qcom,l2 = "l2_cache_active";
		qcom,latency-us = <100>;
		qcom,ss-power = <650>;
		qcom,energy-overhead = <801>;
		qcom,time-overhead = <200>;
	};
};
